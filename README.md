# Ratatui playground

This is a playground repo to play around with [Ratatui](https://ratatui.rs/).

One of my main goals is to understand if I can structure my Ratatui application in an Elm-like fashion.

The provided templates from the Ratatui official sources write code in a very procedural way, abusing of mutability a bit too much for my taste. (That is, using `&mut` all over the place in function arguments).

I want to minimize the usage of mutability and build the most pure functional TUI apps that I can.

I feel that Elm has always been a great example to follow when it comes to building frontend in a pure-functional style, and so I will try to reproduce it in here.
